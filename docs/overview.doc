## Tools
A RptrJS tool is any unit of functionality/utility that could be helpful sometimes, but doesn't warrant being included in the base RptrJS library. This is intended to keep the library lightweight yet extensible.

## Namespace
The global namespace for RptrJS is ``rptr``.  Most of the methods fall into this first level, eg: ``rptr.subscribe``, ``rptr.build``, rather than ``rptr.events.subscribe`` or ``rptr.dom.build``. The goal is to keep RptrJS trim enough to maintain this structure.
